# Restaurant-Order-Analysis-Maven-Analytics

As a Data Analyst at Taste of the World Caf√©, I was tasked with analyzing customer order data to evaluate the performance of a newly launched menu. The goal was to identify top-performing dishes, uncover underperforming items, and understand customer preferences to guide future menu decisions.

### Key Objectives

*   Explore the 'menu\_items' table to gain insights into the new offerings and their categories.
    
*   Analyze the 'order\_details' table to examine customer purchase behavior and order trends.
    
*   Combine both datasets to assess customer reactions, identify best-selling and least popular items, and determine patterns among top customers.
    

### Techniques & Tools Used

*   SQL: Joins, aggregation, window functions, and CTEs for data extraction and transformation.
    
*   Data Visualization: Created insights using pivot tables and charts to highlight trends.
    
*   Customer Segmentation: Identified high-value customers and their preferred menu items.
    

### Insights & Business Impact

*   Top-performing menu items: Discovered the most frequently ordered dishes, helping to optimize inventory management.
    
*   Underperforming items: Identified menu items with low sales, guiding potential menu adjustments.
    
*   Customer preferences: Analyzed purchasing habits of top customers to tailor marketing and promotions.
